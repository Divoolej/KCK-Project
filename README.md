VRAS
====

VRAS stands for Very Realistic Ant Simulator. It's an Android application written as a project for human-computer communication classes, using LibGDX and Google Speech API.
VRAS's main concept is controlling a little ant using only voice commands. For example: We move the ant by saying "go up", "dig down" etc. After collecting enough cherries we can upgrate our diggin' kit by saying "upgrade pick". There are very little features, but the application is working properly.
